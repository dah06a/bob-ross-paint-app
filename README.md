# Hackathon Jr Web Dev Bob Ross Paint App Project
This project was created for the mintbean Hiring Hackathon in November of 2021.  The app was designed with React and Bootstrap 5.1 and has been deployed with GitHub pages. It also uses some external dependencies like react-colorful and body-scroll-lock with NPM.  I hope you enjoy the application.  You can try out the finished project at: https://dah06a.github.io/bob-ross-paint-app/.

## Welcome
Thank you for visiting the Bob Ross Painting Project web app! This application is a tribute to Bob Ross and his incredible work. In his television show, 'The Joy of Painting', he inspired others to not only love painting, but to love life. So take a minute to paint along with Bob and experience the joy for yourself. Remember, there are no mistakes, just 'happy little accidents'. And don't forget to add a 'happy little tree' every now and again!

## How To Use The Tools
It's easy to paint with this web app! Start by clicking on the "TOOLS" button in the upper right corner. Next, select the color and size for your brush. You can also select the 'Erase Mode' feature if you want to get rid of some paint. And that's it! Click back to the canvas and start painting your masterpiece.

## How To Use The Menu
The project menu will help you to create and save a masterpiece! Click the 'New Background' button if you want to get a new randomized Bob Ross Painting to use. Or, if you would rather work without a guide, click the 'No Background' button for a nice blank canvas. When you are ready, click the 'Save/Share' button to open a new tab with your save panting. From there, you can download, save, and share your creation!

## Meet The Developer
My name is David Henry and I developed this project during the November-2021 MintBean Hackathon! Thank you for spending some time exploring the project - I hope very much that you enjoyed it. This app was designed using the React.JS Library with hooks, along with Bootstrap 5.1 and the React-Colorful package.
